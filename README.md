# PyPortPlexed

In early development.

Multiplex via ports using subprocess(s) to the n.

Please be aware the for flexibility during development phase, the pyportplex threads
accept a call to eval(). This is extremely powerful so please use caution.


If you left Python for a while to find threads in another language you may come
back home.

PyPortPlexed very simply creates thread like objects that return results via porting
to the n, that can be easily and simply placed directly into a variable to ready to
use with just three lines of code in a Program that imports PyPortPlexed.

Current versions are barebones and would potentially need sanitization depending
on requirements.

Please also understand thoroughly the implications and infinite use cases of eval()
before handing and arguments to PyPortPlex, because currently eval() is implemented
for flexibility while developing.
