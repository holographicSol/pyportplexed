# pyportplexed

In early development.

Multiplex via ports using subprocess(s) to the n.

Please be aware the for flexibility during development phase, the pyportplex threads
accept a call to eval(). This is extremely powerful so please use caution.


If you left Python for a while to find threads in another language you may come
back home.

PyPortPlexed very simply creates thread like objects that return results via porting
to the n, that can be easily and simply placed directly into a variable to ready to
use.

^In just three lines of code in a Program that imports PyPortPlexed.
